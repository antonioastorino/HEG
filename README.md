Huffan's algorithm allows to find the optimal variable length encode for a given alphabet. In this work, Huffman's algorithm is implemented following 3 steps:

- analysis of text file to generate statistics on the information carried by each character
- creation of the tree-like representation of the optimal encoding
- generation of the code associated with each symbol by inspection of the tree
